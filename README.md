# JMM - Jozu Model Manager


## Description

JMM is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the packaging, versioning, and distribution of AI/ML models as OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifacts. By leveraging the familiar workflow of containerization platforms like Docker, JMM enables data scientists and AI developers to encapsulate their models along with all necessary dependencies, configurations, and environments into a standardized, portable format. This facilitates easy sharing and deployment across diverse computing environments, ensuring that models are readily usable without compatibility issues. JMM supports a wide range of AI/ML frameworks, offers robust version control for model iterations, integrates security practices for safe distribution, and provides a seamless connection to model repositories for storing and retrieving models. With JMM, the aim is to streamline the end-to-end lifecycle of AI/ML model management, making it as effortless as managing containerized applications.
